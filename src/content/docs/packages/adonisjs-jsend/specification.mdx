A basic JSend-compliant response is as simple as this:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "post": { "id": 1, "title": "A blog post", "body": "Some useful content" }
  }
}
```

When setting up a JSON API, you'll have all kinds of different types of calls and responses. JSend
separates responses into some basic types, and defines required and optional keys for each type:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Required Keys</th>
    <th>Optional Keys</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>success</td>
    <td>All went well, and (usually) some data was returned.</td>
    <td>status, data</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>fail</td>
    <td>
      There was a problem with the data submitted, or some pre-condition of the API call wasn't
      satisfied
    </td>
    <td>status, data</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>error</td>
    <td>An error occurred in processing the request, i.e. an exception was thrown</td>
    <td>status, message</td>
    <td>code, data</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Example response types

### Success

When an API call is successful, the JSend object is used as a simple envelope for the results, using
the data key, as in the following:

```json title="GET /posts.json"
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "posts": [
      { "id": 1, "title": "A blog post", "body": "Some useful content" },
      { "id": 2, "title": "Another blog post", "body": "More content" }
    ]
  }
}
```

```json title="GET /posts/2.json"
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": { "post": { "id": 2, "title": "Another blog post", "body": "More content" } }
}
```

```json title="DELETE /posts/2.json"
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": null
}
```

Required keys:

- status: Should always be set to "success".
- data: Acts as the wrapper for any data returned by the API call. If the call returns no data (as
  in the last example), data should be set to null.

### Fail

When an API call is rejected due to invalid data or call conditions, the JSend object's data key
contains an object explaining what went wrong, typically a hash of validation errors. For example:

```json title="POST /posts.json (with data body: 'Trying to creating a blog post')"
{
  "status": "fail",
  "data": { "title": "A title is required" }
}
```

Required keys:

- status: Should always be set to "fail".
- data: Again, provides the wrapper for the details of why the request failed. If the reasons for
  failure correspond to POST values, the response object's keys SHOULD correspond to those POST
  values.

### Error

When an API call fails due to an error on the server. For example:

```json title="GET /posts.json"
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Unable to communicate with database"
}
```

Required keys:

- status: Should always be set to "error".
- message: A meaningful, end-user-readable (or at the least log-worthy) message, explaining what
  went wrong.

Optional keys:

- code: A numeric code corresponding to the error, if applicable
- data: A generic container for any other information about the error, i.e. the conditions that
  caused the error, stack traces, etc.

## Whither HTTP?

But wait, you ask, doesn't HTTP already provide a way to communicate response statuses? Why yes,
astute reader, it does. So how does the notion of indicating response status in the message body fit
within the context of HTTP? Two things:

- The official HTTP spec has 41+ status codes, and there are many interpretations on how to use each
  one. JSend, on the other hand, defines a more constrained set of status codes, specifically
  related to handling JSON traffic in the context of a dynamic web UI.
- The spec is meant to be as small, constrained, and generally-applicable as possible. As such, it
  has to be somewhat self-contained. A common pattern for implementing JSON services is to load a
  JavaScript file which passes a JSON block into a user-specified callback. JSON-over-XHR handling
  in many JavaScript frameworks follows similar patterns. As such, the end-user (developer) never
  has a chance to access the HTTP response itself.

So where does that leave us? Accounting for deficiencies in the status quo does not negate the
usefulness of HTTP compliance. Therefore it is advised that server-side developers use both: provide
a JSend response body, and whatever HTTP header(s) are most appropriate to the corresponding body.
