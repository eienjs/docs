The package provides a command to generate a new API KEY. You can use this command to generate a new
API KEY and save it in your `.env` file as the `API_KEY` environment variable.

```sh
node ace generate:api-key
```

Flags available:

- `--show`: Display the key on the terminal instead of writing it to the `.env` file. By default,
  the key is written to the env file.
- `--force`: The `generate:api-key` command does not write the key to the `.env` file when running
  your application in production. However, you can use the `--force` flag to override this behavior.
