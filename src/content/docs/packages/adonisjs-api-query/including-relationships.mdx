The `include` query parameter will load any Model relation or relation count on the resulting
models. All includes must be explicitly allowed using `allowedIncludes`. This method takes an array
of relationship names or `AllowedInclude` instances.

## Basic Usage

```ts
// GET /users?include=posts

const users = await User.query().allowedIncludes('posts');

// users will contain all users with their posts loaded
```

You can specify multiple relationships by separating them with a comma:

```ts
// GET /users?include=posts,permissions

const users = await User.query().allowedIncludes('posts', 'permissions');

// users will contain all users with their posts and permissions loaded
```

## Default includes

There is no way to include relationships by default in this package. Default relationships are
built-in to query builder itself using the `preload` method on the query:

```ts
const users = await User.query().allowedIncludes('friends').preload('posts').withCount('posts');
```

## Disallowed includes

When trying to include a relationship that's not specified in `allowedIncludes`, an
`InvalidIncludeQuery` exception will be thrown. Its exception message contains the allowed includes
for reference.

## Nested relationships

You can load nested relationships using the dot notation.

```ts
// GET /users?include=posts.comments,permissions

const users = await User.query().allowedIncludes('posts.comments', 'permissions');

// users will contain all users with their posts, comments on their posts and permissions loaded
```
